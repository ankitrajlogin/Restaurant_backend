In a Node.js Express project, app.use() is a function that is used to set up middleware in your application. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request (req), response (res), and the next() function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.


If you call app.use() without specifying a path, it applies to all routes.
If you call app.use('/users', someMiddleware), the middleware will only apply to routes that start with /users.
